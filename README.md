This is the "BUNKER" Telegram bot, inspired by the board game. You can try it out here: [BUNKER BOT](https://t.me/bunker_bot_from_bebra).

The project is written in Python using pytelegrambotAPI, asyncio, and standard libraries. This is my first serious development experience, and I've decided to pause work on the bot for now, until I have sufficient skills to implement it properly.

If the bot is still working at the time you read this, I would appreciate your support via Telegram Stars (use the /send command).
